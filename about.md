In school I developed a lot of web-sites. I started with static HTML [site](http://diman199507.narod.ru/). I read many about Search Engine Optimization(ranking, PR), advertising in Internet(banners, context, references, conversion, arbitration traffic, warez).

My first dynamic [site](http://www.gimna1.ru/) was on PHP, on CMS DLE with max PR=3, this site was winner of school sites competition in 2009, after that I do a lot of other sites on DLE. My last experience with PHP was writing tutor-findning [site](http://www.studentplusorg.ru/) with CodeIgniter.

In first year of study in Moscow Institute of Physics and Technology I did simple search engine, It finds sentences in acm.timus.ru, all [sources](https://bitbucket.org/deamoon/deamoonsearch) are opened.

My first working in team was working with guys who developed soft for automotization house. I write on Python some drivers for hardware devices also I worked with Raspberry Pi and Arduino. My small [application](https://github.com/deamoon/arduino_piano) for playing on piezo-buzzer in browser.

In summer 2012 I worked in Moscow Exchange, It was intership in testing department. I wrote functional tests on Python and developed function for Python wrapper of connection library and testing library.

In second year I interested in crypto currency and quantitative analysis. I wrote some [paper](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B8D6agnNbVNdNHhXeUdjVElTT28/view) about it (only in Russian, but with pictures :).

My last big project is [site](http://quantforces.com/) for creation contests, It's on developing. It's team developing and I lead of team, we use bitbucket(git, issues, wiki) and continuous integration(codeship.io). I developed back-end on Django, some frontend(jQuery, Amcharts) and full server side(DigitalOcean). We recieved money grant on developing this product.

I have finished cource on Coursera(Computational investing, part 1). I have familiar with Python Science tools: numPy, panda, sciPy. I always used iPython notebook for writing some paper work, for example [random 3-SAT](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/deamoon/some_science/blob/master/computational_complexity/SAT_final.ipynb)(on Russian)

In programming I interested in developing of scalable, fault-tolerant systems, organization development process. My science interests is economics and machine learning. Bit I always open for new idea that matter.
